# chat-ios
iOS chat app using SwiftUI

## Getting started
* Clone the repo and run `pod install`
* Make sure you have a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file included inside the chat-ios directory. (Read more about how to do that [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)

(For the future me -- check facebook chat from yourself for a copy of this plist file)
